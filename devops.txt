Basic Unix Commands

ls             -   Command used to list
cat            
        
uname               : It tells about the operating system

uname -a          :  It type of linux info,kernel versions

man uname      : It lists all commands related to uname 

To find out Linux version name : 
lsb_release -a  : To find out Linux distribution name and version
cat etc/os-release (fedora AWS) :  To find out Linux distribution name and version  

Installation commands : 
yum   -   i installation cmd is for fedora
apt-get - is for debian machine 

pipe   |               :  A pipe is a form of redirection that is used to send the output of one program to another program for further processing.

cut                  :  

grep (Global Regular Expression Print) : 
This command is  used to search for a string of characters in a specified file, command is used when searching through large log files. 
example : 
Search any line that contains the word in filename on Linux: grep 'word' filename

Advanced commands :


Daemons : A daemon (also known as background processes) is a Linux or UNIX program that runs in the background, the names of daemons conventionalyy end woth 'd' ex : httpd, initd,sshd,nfsd, ipd etc


walk through profile :


setting up Git in AWS :
Switch to root user and `yum install git`:

Configure git.
Set username and ID
Note: Set your own username and ID that you are going to access github with
# git config --global user.name "kollianil"
# git config --global user.id "anilkmr1989@gmail.com" 
# git config --list
check if gitconfig is set with your credentials
# vi ~/.gitconfig

Git :
 Git allow us to create local repository into our system which is accessible and visible to only owner. 
 Each developer has there own local repository where the can make changes and push into Central or Remote repository, where this changes are visible to all contributors.
GitHub: 
It is a central repository where all committed changes are resides. 
A project resides under master branch, each project has one master branch where all contributors are finally pushed their codes or changes.

Basics commands:
git 
To check version of git
# git --version
To create local repository 
# mkdir demo
# cd demo
# git init
To check status 
# git status 
To link our local repo with central repo
# git remote add origin <link of the central repository>

To pull all files from central repo 
#git pull origin master
To add changes into index
# git add <file name>
To commit changes to git
# git commit - m "comment" <file name>
To push file into central repo 
# git push origin master


Git Interview questions  :

to commit and merge : when there are many devlopers to maintaning history 

squash and merge : 

rebase and merge : 

a question asked by one of us as a devops engineer why we should learn git and our responsibilities with that 
as a devop eng we have to understand how to git works
if anything wrong with devlopers for managing git do we have to explain them how pull req works how to create a branch and to give us the profile 


Docker :

Microservices --> Is hosted in containers

Containers --> running the apps

Docker -- containerisation tool

Docker is a platform whic can run manage and ship our containers
Docker is a containerisation tool which can create containers kill containers but which cant manage containers(life cycle)

Docker properties :
provides fast delivery of the applications
has high density and runs more workloads
aids in quick deployement for easy managemnet


Test to check git changes

docker run - to create a container
docker ps - to check the running process state
docker ps -a it will list all the containers 
exit - stop the container
ctrlp+ctrlq - it will be out from the container 
docker inspect  - to check the ip adrees of the container, process etc 


Jenkins : (Manish )

Continous Integration : Build with every change 

Jenkins : (aws)
pwd :

jenkins url :
http://ec2-54-190-59-34.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/

Note :
while adding Jenkins GPG to authorized key so that Jenkins can be installed,
use New Command (which was mentioned in doc )to avoid errors 
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
